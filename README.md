# sample-repo-workflow-order

This repository is a standing example of using special characters (in this case specifically: SPACE, LEFT PAREN, LEFT BRACKET, and TILDE) to control the ordering of workflows in GitHub's Actions tab.

The names of the workflows are made up, but represent the kinds of use cases that a large monorepo will typically encounter -- the variety of important _standardized workflows_ you want at the top, the _mechanics_ (pull requests, CI, etc.) that aren't run manually but are top-of-mind for all developers, and then a sea of team- or situation-specific workflows, followed by internal stuff you'd prefer to hide, like repository dispatch and reusable workflows.

See the Actions tab for how it looks in practice.
